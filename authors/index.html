				<b>Natasha Jarus</b> is probably <i>not</i> a Linux witch.
				She <i>is</i>, however, a Ph.D candidate at the <a href="mst.edu">Missouri University of Science and Technology</a>.
				She's been programming for 16 years and spent 4 years <s>in hell</s> as a student employee maintaining S&amp;T&rsquo;s Linux machines.
			</p>
			<p>
				During her time as a student, tutor, and instructor in the university&rsquo;s Computer Science department,
				she observed that students struggled with the details of programming on computers;
				this struggle impeded clear understanding of the concepts they were implementing.
				Yet, existing classes had no room to teach such skills.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 2016, she taught a new lab course for freshmen and sophomores intended to fill this gap in the curriculum.
				The material for this class, topics she found helpful as a student, as a researcher, and in industry,
				became the basis for this book.
				She realized that students would benefit from having a reference they could look back on throughout their career,
				and allowing them to study ahead left more lab time for hands-on exercises.
			</p>
			<p>
				When not staring out the window dreaming up implausible scenarios for short stories,
				she stares out the window dreaming of functional programming, abstract math, and moving to a distant mountain with her lovely wife and chickens.
